        <h3>About Steven</h3>
        <!-- background info and motivations for becoming an SE-->
          <p>Before I came to Thinkful I was a scientist. 
          I have a Masters degree in Environmental Science
          and I worked at research labs at Mount Sinai and NYU. I'm also
          a licensed real estate agent.</p>

          <p>Although I love science I found that I really enjoy building
            and creating things myself. I was always intrigued by the dynamism
            and innovation of the tech world, so software engineering was
            a natural fit!</p>

          <p>If you looking to hire a new developer or collaborate on a project,
            please reach out! I'm happy to be on the path to becoming a software 
            engineer and can't wait to build the new, exciting software of
            tomorrow!</p>
