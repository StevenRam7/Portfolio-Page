      <h3>About Steven</h3>
      <!-- background info and motivations for becoming an SE-->
      <p>Before I came to Thinkful I was a scientist.
        I have a Masters degree in Environmental Science
        and I worked at research labs at Mount Sinai and NYU.</p>

      <p>Although I love science I found that I really enjoy building
        and creating things myself. I was always intrigued by the dynamism
        and innovation of the tech world, so software engineering was
        a natural fit!</p>

      <p>If you looking to hire a new developer or collaborate on a project,
        please reach out! I'm happy to be on the path to becoming a software
        engineer and can't wait to build the new, exciting software of
        tomorrow!</p>
